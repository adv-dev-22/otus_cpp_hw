## Thread safe queue.

To develop a class which allows to read/write/modify data inside in a thread safety mode.
To use for this purpose c++11 standard or greater.
The class should be templated (the type of data to work with is a template parameter).

## Functional requirements
 - to read/write internal state into file system
 - data interaction/modification should be prioritized
 - tests coverage
 - benchmarks
 - if queue is full or empty return false (non blocking method) immediately.
