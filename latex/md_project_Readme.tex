To develop a class which allows to read/write/modify data inside in a thread safety mode. To use for this purpose c++11 standard or greater. The class should be templated (the type of data to work with is a template parameter).

\subsection*{Functional requirements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item to read/write internal state into file system
\item data interaction/modification should be prioritized
\item tests coverage
\item benchmarks
\item if queue is full or empty return false (non blocking method) immediately.
